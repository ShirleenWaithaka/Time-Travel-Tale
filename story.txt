Life thry say is full of splendor and magic
As moments flash by, new memories are created
As I take a seat by the window, is seated a lovely lady
In the ancient past there were two lovebirds, Romeo and Juliet
The lovebirds loved spending time together.
They thought about their future and what their family would be.
Everyone loved them.
