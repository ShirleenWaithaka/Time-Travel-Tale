Life thry say is full of splendor and magic
As moments flash by, new memories are created
As I take a seat by the window, is seated a lovely lady
In the ancient days, there were two lovebirds Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo and Juliet loved each other dearly.
They would spend time together working planning for their future.
Their love story inspired alot of people that it was written in a book.
